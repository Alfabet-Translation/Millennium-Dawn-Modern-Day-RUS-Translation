 USA_launch_pad_in_brazil: "Пусковая площадка в Бразилии"
 USA_launch_pad_in_brazil_desc: "Rockets, believe it or not, need to get to space in order to do anything useful.

 USA_aluminium_and_steel_production_desc: "Мы можем похвастаться четвертой по величине добычей стали и шестым - алюминия в  мире. Тем не менее, недавние разработки в области 3D-печати открыли совершенно новый рынок, жаждущий этих ресурсов.

 USA_industrial_oversight_committee_desc: "Нам нужно найти новые и эффективные способы предоставления регулирующих услуг, если мы не хотим, чтобы наше обширное правительственное регулирование полностью задуло промышленный рост.

 USA_military_production_centralization_reform: "Инвестиции в оборонную промышленность"
 USA_military_production_centralization_reform_desc: "Возможно, настало время укрепить нашу позицию в отрасли, чтобы принести пользу нашему военному производству.

 USA_expand_the_monetary_control_act_desc: "Закон о валютном контроле был частью Закона, принятого в 1980 году, который открыл окно со скидкой для ФРС, позволяющее множеству финансовых учреждений заимствовать у Федерального резерва.

Мы должны поработать над увеличением добычи ресурсов в Аляске."
 USA_build_additional_steel_factories: "Американская сталь"
 USA_build_additional_steel_factories_desc: "Американская сталелитейная промышленность застопорилась в последние годы. Крайне важно спонсировать нашу металлургическую промышленность, чтобы удовлетворить огромный спрос, возникший в Соединенных Штатах."

 USA_revive_the_rust_belt_desc: "Огромные области того, что когда-то называлось Стальным поясом, в течение нескольких десятилетий томились из-за потери рабочих мест, потери населения и общей потери надежды, поскольку отрасли в значительной степени вышли из-за разочарованного и бедного населения.

 USA_strengthen_the_military_industrial_complex_desc: "Есть те, кто утверждает, что Военно-промышленный комплекс является непрозрачной кабкой недобросовестных бизнесменов, которые получают прибыль от гибели миллионов невинных людей. И тогда есть те, которые рассматривают их как отличного делового партнера."

 USA_encourage_growth_in_the_rocky_mountains_desc: "Скалистые горы, возможно, не совсем первый выбор любого молодого молодого предпринимателя, который хочет начать следующий успешный бизнес. Если мы хотим исправить это, мы должны, по крайней мере, освободить место для роста новых отраслей."

 USA_encourage_growth_in_the_american_south_desc: "Юг никогда не был наиболее финансово успешной частью Соединенных Штатов, но к концу 20-го века их сектор услуг, производственная база и энергетическая промышленность, казалось, росли почти экспоненциально.

 usa_vanilla.41.t: "Representatives Speaks Passionately in the House"
 usa_vanilla.41.desc: "Asked about her stance on a number of policy issues at a fund-raising dinner, a representative spoke out in support of President [USA.GetLeader]'s policies. She further claimed that many of her fellow representatives had similar views, but were merely held back by "idiotic short-sightedness, thinking no further than the next election" instead of doing what was right for the American people. \n\nHer comments have been widely reported by the press and put several of her colleagues in hot water as they had to explain where they stood on these issues."

 usa_vanilla.42.t: "Senator Voices Opposition Towards Recent Policy"
 usa_vanilla.42.desc: "A Senator has given an interview in a major newspaper, saying that he can no longer support the "foolish and dangerous" policies of President [USA.GetLeader].

 #Travel Ban Event Chain
 donald_trump.0.t: "The Travel Ban"
 donald_trump.0.d: "With terrorism afoot around the globe, it is imperative we protect our citizens. We can protect Americans through enacting the Executive Order titled 'Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States,' banning the residents of certain Muslim-majority countries with high prevalences of Muslim extremists. These countries, listed by the Obama administration, are Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Yemen, and Somalia.\n\nHowever, getting this ban through without legal trouble may be difficult if we just include these countries, so expanding the ban to places like Venezuela, Chad, and North Korea would help dilute the list of countries and perhaps give us a better chance of having no legal trouble in the first place. It would take additional time to change, however. Do be aware that enacting this policy may have us face reciprocal policies from countries affected by our policy.\n\nWhat should we do?"
 donald_trump.0.o1: "Keep the ban limited"
 donald_trump.0.o2: "Expand the ban to other countries around the globe"

 donald_trump.1.t: "Travel Ban Challenged by Federal Courts"
 donald_trump.1.d1: "Today, just one day after the Travel Ban was set into effect, multiple courts sued our Administration over apparent breaches of the First Amendment, the Fith Amendment, the Tenth Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, and various laws and a UN convention. This complaint is made despite the Constitution giving the President 'unreviewable authority' over immigration matters.\n\nWe have appealed this decision, but whatever the constitution says doesn't matter, it's what the court decides, and thus far, it seems stacked against us. Rewriting the Executive Order would perhaps allow us to better prepare against these lawsuits. Alternatively, we could just either try to push the current ban through or withdraw from a Travel Ban altogether. What shall we do, Mr. President?"
 donald_trump.1.d2: "Today, just one day after the Travel Ban was set into effect, multiple courts sued our Administration over apparent breaches of the Fith Amendment, the Tenth Amendment and various laws and a UN convention. This complaint is made despite the Constitution giving the President 'unreviewable authority' over immigration matters.\n\nWe have appealed this decision, but whatever the constitution says doesn't matter, it's what the court decides, and thus far, it seems somewhat stacked against us. Rewriting the Executive Order would perhaps allow us to better prepare against these lawsuits. Alternatively, we could just either try to push the current ban through or withdraw from a Travel Ban altogether. What shall we do, Mr. President?"
 donald_trump.1.o1: "Revise the ban"
 donald_trump.1.o2: "Push the ban through!"
 donald_trump.1.o3: "We can't afford to be entangled in legal battles"

 donald_trump.2.t: "Travel Ban Rejected in Federal Courts"
 donald_trump.2.d1: "The attempt to appeal to the courts over the Travel Ban has failed. The court adjudicated that our appeal has been dismissed. The Travel Ban, at this moment, has hardly any effect. We can remedy this decision by revising the ban. Conversely, we could bring it to the Supreme Court, though more Republican judges would make that process easier, or we can just drop the ban. Mr. President?"
 donald_trump.2.d2: "The attempt to appeal to the courts over our expanded Travel Ban has failed. The court adjudicated that our appeal has been dismissed. The Travel Ban, at this moment, has hardly any effect. We can remedy this decision by revising the ban. Conversely, we could bring it to the Supreme Court, though more Republican judges would make that process easier, or we can just drop the ban. Mr. President?"
 donald_trump.2.d3: "The attempt to appeal to the courts over our redone Travel Ban has failed. The court adjudicated that our appeal has been dismissed, just like the previous ban. Unfortunately, unlike the previous ban, we cannot really change the ban much without angering much of our base, so a move like that would be political suicide. That leaves our one option open being the Supreme Court, or we can just drop the ban and forget it. Mr. President, what shall we do?"
 donald_trump.2.o1: "Bring it to the Supreme Court!"
 donald_trump.2.o2: "Revise the ban"
 donald_trump.2.o3: "We can't afford to be entangled in legal battles"

 donald_trump.3.t: "Travel Ban Challenged by Federal Courts Again"
 donald_trump.3.d: "Our best hopes and wishes have not been fulfilled. After replacing the previous Travel Ban with a better, more resistant one, the courts have sued again. This time, however, the chances of an appeal going through is much higher, and so there is a serious chance that we could get the Travel Ban fully operational. Of course, even with the heightened chances, there is still a good probability that it fails. What shall we do?"
 donald_trump.3.o1: "Push the ban through!"
 donald_trump.3.o2: "We can't afford to be entangled in legal battles"

 donald_trump.4.t: "The Ban is Brought Before the Supreme Court"
 donald_trump.4.d: "All of our previous challenges have been at lower level courts. However, the Supreme Court is the highest court of the land, so their decision trumps all. Mr. President, surely you will win this time."
 donald_trump.4.o1: "Let the process begin"

 donald_trump.5.t: "The Court Votes Against the Ban"
 donald_trump.5.d: "Despite our best efforts, the best team of lawyers, the best tactics, the best campaigning, the Travel Ban has failed. Any further attempt to pass any travel ban is mute. This has been an unfortunate end."
 donald_trump.5.o1: "This was a waste of time"

 donald_trump.6.t: "The Court Votes Uphold Ban"
 donald_trump.6.d: "The persistent struggle for keeping the Travel Ban has paid off. The Supreme Court of the United States has upholded our Travel Ban. This is a great day, one of many to come."
 donald_trump.6.o1: "We finally have an end to this madness"

 donald_trump.7.t: "Travel Ban Succeeds"
 donald_trump.7.d1: "To our surprise, no-one has dared to challenge the Administration over the Travel Ban. This certainly is a surpise to us, but it's most definitely a welcome one."
 donald_trump.7.d2: "Despite the intentions of Democrats, the Travel Ban has succeeded. The days of court battles over the Travel Ban are over."
 donald_trump.7.d3: "Through being challenged, refused, revised, challenged again, and appealed, we can now finally see the Travel Ban be fully enacted with little fear of being sued again over it. The days of court battles over these Executive Orders are finally over."
 donald_trump.7.o1: "Huzzah!"

 #Asteroid Mining Event Chain
 donald_trump.8.t: "Launching the Asteroid Mining Initiative"
 donald_trump.8.d: "Asteroid Mining has been a fantasy for many before us. Asteroids themselves carry much wanted platinum group metals, gold, silver, and iron group metals. It could become extremely lucrative for any spacefaring country. So today, the establishment of an Asteroid Mining Initiative, or AMI, will provide the first step towards mining asteroids. Using vast telescope arrays across the United States, we can look for suitable asteroids in nearby outer space, then pull it into orbit and mine it. Spotting a suitable asteroid will be difficult, as, relative to the distance they are at, they are quite small. Luckily, there's actually quite a few which pass by Earth every so often, so it wouldn't take long to get one to stay in Earth's orbit."
 donald_trump.8.o1: "Just need to wait for an asteroid..."

 donald_trump.9.t: "Asteroid Spotted"
 donald_trump.9.d: "Recently, our scientists at NASA spotted a suitable asteroid passing near Earth. This has been a relief for the AMI, as some doubted if we'd actually ever spot a suitable, economical asteroid at all. However, this asteroid is moving slowly enough, is large enough, and is rich enough to be moved into orbit and mined. The asteroid is, in-fact, larger than the state of New York. The next step is simply to move this asteroid into orbit around Earth, which has never been done before. In the meantime, NASA engineers, and even private enterprises like SpaceX, have invented mechanisms to mine the asteroid, so they will be ready by the time the asteroid gets into orbit."
 donald_trump.9.o1: "Let's get that baby into orbit"

 donald_trump.10.t: "Asteroid in Orbit"
 donald_trump.10.d: "With the asteroid in orbit, NASA and SpaceX are both sending missions to the orbiting asteroid. NASA is mainly concerned about collecting scientific data, while SpaceX is more concerned about mining the material. No doubt this is a noteworthy achievement, which gives us an edge in space. There is even talk about bringing in more asteroids, but many say that additional asteroids can come later, as this asteroid is very large and well suited for mining. Other countries are already looking at us with envy, and are considering their own asteroid mining programs. The costs are extremely high even to develop the technology to even get there, so there is little worry among SpaceX or NASA that competition will arive."
 donald_trump.10.o1: "Mining shall begin"

 donald_trump.11.t: "Profits from Mining Start Pouring in"
 donald_trump.11.d: "After establishing mining operations, SpaceX and NASA have both sent back their first shipments of space-material to labs and markets around the globe. The world has jelously looked on us, and there have been open talks in their respective chambers of legislation about opening their own asteroid mining operations. While we soon may get competition, we can enjoy the monopoly for now."
 donald_trump.11.o1: "Huzzah!"

 donald_trump.12.t: "Profits from Asteroid Mining"
 donald_trump.12.d: "The latest shipments from our asteroid mining operations have come in, and have generated many revenues. These shipments include platinum, gold, and silver. Putting the revenues to good use would be wise."
 donald_trump.12.o1: "Excellent!"

 donald_trump.13.t: "Potential for Asteroid Mining"
 donald_trump.13.d: "Recently, Donald Trump has allowed NASA and SpaceX, a private space company, to bring a fairly large asteroid into orbit of Earth and mine it. Our advisors recommend we invest in this new space, as it could allow rare materials to be delivered straight to our country. Some, however, have cited the massive bill the United States had to pay to even start the operations, and oppose expanding into space. The return for this investment depends, but it may take 25 years to just break even. More substantial investment can bring this down, but we'll be far behind the United States for quite a while.\n\nWhat shall we do in regards to Asteroid Mining? Start a national program, or ignore it altogether?"
 donald_trump.13.o1: "Invest in Asteroid Mining"
 donald_trump.13.o2: "Too expensive and a waste of our time!"

 #Mission To Mars Event Chain

 #Some events are out of order for the event number, but in order for the chain both in the code and order it appears
 donald_trump.23.t: "Mission to Mars"
 donald_trump.23.d: "Mr. President, with funding secured, and plans complete, we can now prepare a group of men and women to withstand the immense pressure and loneliness in space in order to reach Mars.\n\nLuckily, NASA has already been preparing for such a trip for years, it's just not had the funding to launch a full program. The additional training of current astronauts and preparation of the rocket will start in earnest.\n\nThis process will take roughly a year for it to complete. In the mean time, scientists at NASA laboratories are preparing scientific equipment to be sent along with the astronauts to Mars to collect useful scientific data that one cannot achieve with a rover. Do keep in mind, SpaceX may attempt to get a man there first upon hearing the announcement."
 donald_trump.23.o1: "Preparations shall begin"

 donald_trump.24.t: "Space Race"
 donald_trump.24.d: "In a recent news release, SpaceX has decided to launch its own program to get to Mars in under a year. Now, if SpaceX gets there first, it will still be an achievement that you can use for additional investment into space, however, it will be... let's just say... not as politically convinient.\n\nThis new Space Race for Mars will require additional investment if we are wanting to secure victory first, however, some experts argue that Elon Musk's program lacks certain aspects required to go to Mars with a crewed mission there and back. We may just be able to get to Mars first without assigning additional funds to NASA.\n\nWhat is your directive, Mr. President?"
 donald_trump.24.o1: "Space Race it is!"
 donald_trump.24.o2: "Continue at the current pace"

 donald_trump.14.t: "Mission to Mars Ready"
 donald_trump.14.d: "NASA has just sent confirmation that the astronauts, equipment, and rocket are ready. There are six particular astronauts heading to Mars with a return journey. The astronauts heading to Mars are as follows: Michael, Paul, Edward, Rodney, Mary, and Anne. These astronauts have prepared over the past two years, and are the most fit astronauts for this mission. The rocket, NASA's recent Space Launch System, is ready to be launched. The capsule, the Orion Space Capsule, is also ready.\n\nFortunately, the next launch window is in 30 days."
 donald_trump.14.o1: "30 days until launch!"

 donald_trump.15.t: "On the Launch Pad"
 donald_trump.15.d: "[GetDateText]:\nOur six astronauts are ready. It will be a long difficult journey, but they are prepared for it. Paul seems especially excited about the prospect, while the rest of the crew is nervous, particularly Rodney, albeit willing.\n\nThe Astronauts are in the rocket, ready to blast off into Space. They gave their farewells to family and friends, for they will not see them in person for nearly two years. All are optimistic for a successful mission.\n\nThe countdown has begun, with the launch confirmed."
 donald_trump.15.o1: "3, 2, 1..."

 donald_trump.16.t: "Lift Off!"
 donald_trump.16.d: "Launch Control has certified liftoff, and the rocket and crew are heading to Mars! People's heads are towards the sky, as the rocket heading for orbit. Its crew are both ecstatic and relieved, as it's a perfect launch. Everything has worked so far, and there is much hope that it will continue to work for months to come.\n\nThe dream is near complete."
 donald_trump.16.o1: "An exciting day in history"

 donald_trump.17.t: "Disaster Strikes!"
 donald_trump.17.d: "The rocket has exploded!\n\nIt turns out that the essential final checks were inadequate to stop a catastrophe. It has been reported that all six crew members, Michael, Paul, Edward, Rodney, Mary, and Anne, have died in this calamity. The spectators on the ground are watching in disbelief as flames engulf the launch pad. It will much weaken the will for space in the coming future, and will be a stain on your presidency."
 donald_trump.17.o1: "A fatal accident"

 donald_trump.18.t: "Insanity in Space"
 donald_trump.18.d: "It turns out that prolonged periods in isolation with only five others to talk to are not suitable at all for the human psyche.\n\nDespite going through severe training before-hand, one astronaut, Michael, went mentally insane and attempted to manually control the craft to return to Earth as soon as possible. Anne, the only other person awake at the time, attempted to get in his way and halt him, however, she was unable to wrestle him away from the controls. While she was attempting to do this, Michael punched Anne in the jaw, knocking her unconcious.\n\nFortunately, the other crew members were wakened by the disorder, and immediately jumped to aid Anne. A quick struggle ensued where the control panel was slightly dented, however, everything remains operational and Michael is now in a makeshift prison with makeshift handcuffs. Additional good news, Anne was not permanently injured, and will be able to recover within a week on the vessel. Whether she has long term damage would have to be investigated by doctors at home.\n\nThe bad news is that the rocket is widely off-course. Additionally, a lot of fuel was burned in Michael's hasty attempt to return to Earth.\n\nThere are two options: Return to Earth with all the astronauts, arresting Michael for assualt and endangering five other lives, or send them on a one way trip to Mars. The five astronauts have expressed that they are willing to sacrifice themselves for the good of humanity.\n\nMr. President. What is your choice?"
 donald_trump.18.o1: "If the remaining astronauts are ready for it, then let them go"
 donald_trump.18.o2: "Let's get our men and women home, and arrest that son of a bitch"

 donald_trump.19.t: "Shamed Return"
 donald_trump.19.d: "Months ago, an altercation onboard the rocket to Mars forced the astronauts onboard to return to Earth to avoid a one-way trip. Anne has been sent to the hospital to investigate if she has injuries undiscovered by the crew, and Michael has been arrested and will likely be sent to a mental hospital. The other astronauts, other than Mary, have offered their services again to space, while Mary has decided to retire from her astronaut career early. They are all happy to be home alive.\n\nThis is likely the end to any government program to send humans to Mars for quite a long time to come."
 donald_trump.19.o1: "Unfortunate, but at least they're alive"

 donald_trump.20.t: "Sacrifice on Mars"
 donald_trump.20.d: "Weeks ago, an altercation onboard the rocket to Mars forced the astronauts to make the difficult decision to commit to a one-way trip to Mars. They have landed and have explored the Martian surface. They only have so long to live, so they intend to make the most of it. Significant research opportunities will result from this, however, it comes at a cost of human life. Stranded, and without a permanent source of food, the crew will starve and die on Mars, leaving their bodies on the surface until, hopefully, one day, a team comes to Mars to retrieve them and give a proper burial on Earth. Until then, they will lie there for eternity."
 donald_trump.20.o1: "Martyrs on Mars"

 donald_trump.21.t: "The Eagle has Landed"
 donald_trump.21.d1: "The landing on Mars is a success! The crew onboard is joyous, and the viewers at home on Earth are as excited as ever for space travel. They will stay here for a few days, taking scientific samples and experiments, before heading back to Earth. The excitement for space will ensure that future missions into space will be politically easy to do, and will enhance the popularity of your presidency. However, the United States is now, once again, pushing the boundaries of space."
 donald_trump.21.d2: "The NASA landing on Mars, the second successful landing to be had on Mars, is a success! The crew onboard is joyous, and the viewers at home on Earth, with this and the SpaceX landing, are as excited as ever for space travel. They will stay here for a few days, taking scientific samples and experiments, before heading back to Earth. The excitement for space will ensure that future missions into space will be politically easy to do, and will enhance the popularity of your presidency. However, the United States, both public and private, is now, once again, pushing the boundaries of space."

 donald_trump.22.d1: "Michael, Paul, Edward, Rodney, Mary, and Anne have made it home safely on a trip which will make the history books as one of the most important space flights ever to have been achieved. They bring back countless rocks and priceless data that will be processed in laboratories all around the globe. Hopefully, this will pave the way for the future colonization of Mars."
 donald_trump.22.d2: "Despite being second, Michael, Paul, Edward, Rodney, Mary, and Anne have made it home safely on a round trip to Mars. They bring back countless rocks and priceless data that will be processed in laboratories all around the globe. Hopefully, this, along with the SpaceX landing, will pave the way for the future colonization of Mars."

 donald_trump.25.d1: "Despite our best efforts, SpaceX has managed to land on Mars first, beating us in the space race. They have landed their Starship on the Martian surface. This task for a private company was a huge undertaking, and we applaud them just for getting to Mars first, before NASA with it's huge financial advantage. We still celebrate this occasion, as it will bring many new discoveries to the sciences of space exploration and Mars."
 donald_trump.25.d2: "SpaceX is the second organization to land on Mars. They have landed their Starship on the Martian surface. This task for a private company was a huge undertaking, and we applaud them just for getting to Mars, just after NASA with it's huge financial advantage. We still celebrate this occasion, since it will hopefully lead to successes in the future for SpaceX and Elon Musk."
 donald_trump.25.d3: "SpaceX is the second organization to land on Mars, albeit will likely be the first to do a successful round trip. They have landed their Starship on the Martian surface, near the site where we landed our doomed mission, and are taking the bodies home, much to the relief of their families at home. This task for a private company was a huge undertaking, and we applaud them just for getting to Mars. We still celebrate this occasion, since it will hopefully lead to successes in the future for SpaceX and Elon Musk."

 #Lunar Outpost Event Chain

 donald_trump.26.t: "Outpost on the Moon"
 donald_trump.26.d: "Our scientists and engineers are ready to send astronauts and equipment to live semi-permanently on the Moon. A total sum of roughly 12 astronauts will be sent there, along with tens of millions of dollars worth of equipment, supplies, living spaces, and personal items. This outpost will need to be regularly moved as the Lunar day lasts 29 Earth days, which is far too long for batteries to keep stored power on the Moon.\n\nThe base itself will be on the poles, easily moveable, to get the maximum usage of our solar panels. Additionally, experiments will be carried out to determine long-term living conditions on the Moon. Extraction of lunar ice could not only lead to liquid water for plants and food for astronauts on the Moon, but also lead to separating it into oxygen and hydrogen, rocket fuel.\n\nThis may take months or years to get the research needed to do this. Within this time, however, using the funds for this project, we will build a depot orbiting the Moon to allow easier access to the Moon, and refueling to get to Earth.\n\nAll of this is achievable within the next decade. Now, however, is the time to launch."
 donald_trump.26.o1: "Launch!"

 donald_trump.27.t: "Moonbase Alpha"
 donald_trump.27.d: "Our scientists and engineers have officially landed on the Moon, and are currently in the process of setting up the Moon-base. Each section is divided into \"modules,\" not quite buildings on their own, but not together as one. There is a habitation module, for rest, food module, for growing food, lab module, which is the largest with most of the scientific equipment, a maintenance module, containing all the maintenance tools to repair things if they get broken, an amenities module, since these people are here for 6 months, and working all day everyday isn't good for the mind, and quite a few solar panels.\n\nFood deliveries will be common for these first months as it takes time to grow food. Water and oxygen will be obtained through the Lunar ice. Lastly, these scientists will stay until shortly after moving to the next location in roughly 6 months time when the solar panels become defunct due to the Lunar day and night where the outpost is located lasts 6 months.\n\nMoonbase Alpha is complete."
 donald_trump.27.o1: "Science!"

 donald_trump.28.t: "Colony Progresses"
 donald_trump.28.d: "Our scientific outpost on the Moon has had a major breakthrough. With expansion of their current solar panel network, and recent discoveries making separating water to make oxygen and hydrogen easier, they have been able to come up with enough oxygen and hydrogen to fully fuel the most recent supply rocket. This is such a necessary breakthrough which will allow the Moon itself, given enough time and investment, can become a hub for future space ventures into outer space.\n\nSpace itself is getting smaller."
 donald_trump.28.o1: "We're good at being pioneers"

 donald_trump.29.t: "Crisis on the Moon"
 donald_trump.29.d: "Drastic measures need to be taken place immediately. For reasons currently unknown, the habitation module has ruptured and \"exploded.\"\n\nAn hour ago, all 12 scientists were doing their duties when, all of a sudden, there was a massive rupture in the habitation module.\n\nSince waves don't travel in a vacuum, most didn't realize until they physically saw what had happened.\n\nThere is an emergency fund as part of the budget, so there is no need to allocate more funds to the project, and the scientists can always sleep in the other isolated modules; however, this has spooked many, stating that a few, many, or even all of our scientists could have died, and has also lowered the morale of the scientists since they could have died. Thus, attempting to continue the outpost on the Moon will be politically costly, and a rotation of scientists may need to happen now rather than later, due to the sapping of morale.\n\nWhat shall we do?"
 donald_trump.29.o1: "Send emergency aid!"
 donald_trump.29.o2: "Abandon the project. It's not meant for us"

 donald_trump.30.t: "Colony Progresses Further"
 donald_trump.30.d: "Our Moon outpost has made another major breakthrough. They have managed to ship Hydrogen 3, a gas which seems perfect for fusion, to Earth, and scientists at home have figured out how to conduct fusion with it! Not only this, but the power generated from this fusion is near the amount used to do the reaction in the first place. This means that, with some improvements, this could result in successful fusion power! Not only does this allow immense benefits at home, along with knowledge we may be able to use in using other materials for fusion, we can use this on the Moon, allowing a permanent outpost rather than mobile outposts!\n\nAll of this is far ahead of schedule, which is a surpise, and many at NASA have been left unprepared to implement this into the current Moonbase. So, a new Moonbase is needed, in a much better spot for rapid expansion than the current location of Moonbase Alpha. It's time to start preparations on Moonbase Beta."
 donald_trump.30.o1: "Life continues on"

 donald_trump.31.t: "Another Crisis on the Moon"
 donald_trump.31.d: "More drastic measures need to be taken now. Two more modules have ruptured. This time, it's both the Food and Amenities modules.\n\nRoughly forty minutes ago, a scientist was about to enter the Food module when it suddenly exploded. The scientist is fine, and no-one but the plants were harmed. However, it was adjacent to the Amenities module, and it caused it to rupture and explode. Again, no-one was hurt.\n\nThis new occurance, however, has raised the hairs of many back home, questioning the saftey of the modules. After the previous explosion, NASA replaced the modules, ensuring that they wouldn't explode, but it seems like prolonged pressure can cause something to break much more easily than it would otherwise. NASA has already quickly responded, ordering new modules be made immediately, as well as a close inspection of all current modules (As you can't \"recall\" modules from the Moon as of this moment).\n\nWith mounting pressure at home to stop going forward with the project until all safety concerns are resolved, the continuation of the Moonbase program comes into question. In addition to the political pushback, the emergency fund has been cut in half, so NASA is requesting another $5 billion to sort out future concerns. It remains your choice to decide whether to continue."
 donald_trump.31.o1: "Send more emergency aid!"
 donald_trump.31.o2: "We can't continue doing things like this"

 donald_trump.32.t: "Moonbase Beta"
 donald_trump.32.d: "At this point, our scientists and engineers on the Moon need to move to another location on the poles. The costs for doing this are already established in the long-term budget, so we don't need to add any new funding to the project yet.\n\nWith this new moonbase, we will be able to use new discoveries we have uncovered to allow the base to be established permanently, unlike our previous moonbase.With the use of better rockets, better power generation, better ice extraction and separation, we can use this new base, at a site more suited for rapid expansion, to facilitate colonization efforts of the Moon. This is not the only good news, entreprenuers and corporations are flooding to NASA en-mass for requests to put their newly developed mining systems on the Moon. Even other space programs in other countries are now extremely interested in starting up scientific and mining outposts on the Moon, however, due to your dilligent efforts, we not only have a massive head start, but we are the only country actively attempting to colonize the Moon.\n\nThe future on our Moon is bright and American."

 donald_trump.500.d: "For years, ISIS has been a terrorist threat not seen ever in history. Their influence is all over the globe, and while their in Iraq and Syria shrinks, their strangleholds in other areas continues. A determined bombing campaign would put an end to the terrorist threat. It would certainly be costly; however, it would lead to the eventual demise of ISIS. Another approach is to simply continue operations normally, still pounding ISIS troops, but with far less costs than the former option. A last option is to fully withdraw from the campaign against ISIS as it has almost been won already. While this would strengthen ISIS, it would allow us to divert resources to other areas. Mr. President, what shall we do?"

Donald Trump tweeted upon the matter, calling ISIS a \"dead terrorist group\" and that \"US troops will focus on other things.\" Supporters call this move necessary to limit unnecessary expenditure, while the opposition state that this will only make the terrorism situation worse.

One particular favorite, SpaceX, was pointed out directly in his speech on the AMI, stating \"Smart people, and boy, do we have some smart people, like my good friend at SpaceX, Elon Musk, will be able to send their space mining equipment to the asteroid, mine it, and sell it for profit. It will be a tremendous business, believe me.\" There are serious concerns for asteroid mining, however the Administration has been dismissive of those concerns, instead focusing on the rewards of the project.

A relatively slow asteroid, it was pulled into an elliptical orbit with Earth. Mining operations started as soon as it was in orbit. This news has been a surpise to the world, as it has been done far faster than expected. Many countries are now seeking to start their own asteroid mining programs to counteract the American monopoly. The United States does claim the entire asteroid. However, this claim can only be sparsely enforced as the asteroid is so large. Asteroid mining will likely become a lucrative industry, with many successes and failures.

There is one problem: Many are unskilled\n\nImmigration is a healthy way to import young, enthusiastic workers from around the world to contribute to your society. However, the American immigration system is broken, as most of the people coming into the United States are unskilled. Now, these people may be the hardest working laborers of their home countries, but the United States is a modern economy, where unskilled labor isn't as valued as skilled or educated labor. The result is the depreciation of wages of the lower classes, and a clear job gap in educated fields. Not only that, but welfare programs give money to immigrants, even undocumented immigrants.\n\nThis system needs to be fixed, but neither side can agree to fix it, so it remains broken, for now."

 american_immigration_system2_desc: "The immigration system has been fixed. No longer do the majority of immigrants come from unskilled backgrounds, but rather skilled and educated backgrounds."

 made_in_china_desc: "Many of our corporations have moved their industry from here to China. When we allowed China into the WTO in 2001, this was not the prospect we hoped for. What makes this worse is that China violates our intellectual property rights, stealing hundreds of billions of dollars worth of intellectual property each year. Not only this, but they are becoming ever more powerful and hostile to us. The last thing we want is to be attached to a more powerful, hostile regime."
