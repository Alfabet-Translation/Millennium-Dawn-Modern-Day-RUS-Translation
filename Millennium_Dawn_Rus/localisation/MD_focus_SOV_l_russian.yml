 SOV_attack_chechnya_desc:0 "The Second Chechen War begun in August of 1999, when Chechen fighters, whose state, Ichkeria, enjoyed de facto independence since the First Chechen War of 1996, began with a large-scale military infiltration of the neighboring Dagestan province. The Russian military's retaliation has resulted in a siege of the Chechen capital city of Grozny. The city is likely to fall by late January or early February."

Путин, получив новую поддержку от победы над чеченцами, теперь стремится укрепить свою политическую легитимность президентскими выборами в марте 2000 года."

 SOV_putin_desc:0 "Владимир Владимирович Путин (1952 г. р.) - назначенный Борисом Николаевичем Ельциным политический наследник и безусловный фаворит на выборах. Его политическая деятельность началась в секретной службе, когда он работал в Восточной Германии для советского КГБ. В Российской Федерации он впервые стал директором Федеральной службы безопасности в 1998 году, а затем был назначен заместителем премьер-министра при Ельцине в августе 1999 года."
 SOV_zhirinovsky:0 "Жириновский"
 SOV_zhirinovsky_desc:0 "Vladimir Zhirinovsky (born 1946) has been the leader of the hyper-nationalistic Liberal Democratic Party of Russia since 1991. Well known, among other things, for a juice fight with centrist politician Boris Nemtsov in 1995, Zhirinovsky stands for belligerent and rash policies. One of his proposals is to contaminate the NATO-aligned Baltic states by blowing airborne radioactive waste across the border."

 SOV_zyuganov_desc:0 "Геннадий Зюганов (1944 г.р.) - лидер Коммунистической партии Российской Федерации с 1993 года. В 1996 году Зюганов был фаворитом на президентских выборах против Бориса Ельцина, но затем выставил напоказ досрочное лидерство и проиграл во втором туре с 40,7% голосов против 54,4% у Ельцина. В политическом плане Зюганов занимает позиции левого национализма."

He received 7.3% of the vote in 1996. His support is strongest with urban and middle class voters and his diplomatic policy is amicable towards the western powers."

 SOV_empower_putins_cronies:0 "Расширение прав приспешников Путина"
 SOV_empower_putins_cronies_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, a lot of previously state-owned companies were privatized. An elite class of businessmen, known collectively as the 'oligarchs', became very rich very quickly by buying those corporations at the cheapest of prices and capitalizing on the subsequent economic profits. These oligarchs are now closely aligned with the Yeltsin and Putin administrations."
 SOV_fight_corruption:0 "Борьба с коррупцией"
 SOV_fight_corruption_desc:0 "Instead of continuing Yeltsin's policy of aiding and abetting the oligarchs, Putin should instead attempt to stifle their influence, re-nationalize key industries and increase workplace democracy and industrial government oversight. This would hurt relations with the oil and gas industries and would turn away western investors, but it would fight the rampant corruption in Russian public life."
 SOV_gazprom:0 "Расширить Газпром"
 SOV_gazprom_desc:0 "Gazprom (a portmanteau of Gazovaya Promyshlennost, 'gas industry') was founded in 1989 to serve as the Russian state's prime corporation in the business of the production and sale of natural gas resources.

 SOV_secure_putins_position_desc:0 "After making local and federal alliances with the CPRF and Zyuganov's poor performance in the 2000 election, United Russia can now drive CPRF out of the political process. This will, in the long term, eliminate the communist and neo-Soviet sympathizers as a serious political threat to Putin. After that is completed, the 'two-party system' that Zyuganov envisioned will have become a system of one."

 SOV_nationalize_oligarch_factories_desc:0 "The likes of Leonid Mikhelson of gas giant Novatek, Vladimir Lisin of steel conglomerate Novolipetsk and Vagit Alekperov of oil company LUKOIL are examples of Russian oligarchs that enriched themselves in the immediate aftermath of the Soviet Union's economic collapse.

These corporations, vital to Russia's national defense, are too important to allow them to fail."
 SOV_republican_industrial_project:0 "Республиканский промышленный проект"
 SOV_republican_industrial_project_desc:0 "The late 1990s left Russia in one of its most severe economic crises in modern history. Unemployment is rampant and there is widespread crushing poverty that resulted from the post-Soviet period of rapid privatization and mass emigration of companies and high-quality employees to the west. The 2000s must be better, and civilian industry must be strengthened for domestic and international commerce."
 SOV_take_control_of_the_justice_system:0 "Влияние системы правосудия"
 SOV_take_control_of_the_justice_system_desc:0 "With the 2001 Amendment Law of the Status of Judges in the Russian Federation, Putin officially aimed to introduce stricter oversight and quality control of regional and local judges, with the intent to crack down on corrupt judicial clerks left after the turbulent 1990s. As a useful side effect, Putinist interference in the Russian justice system will leave the domestic intelligence community in charge of most of it."
 SOV_republican_military_project:0 "Республиканский военный проект"
 SOV_republican_military_project_desc:0 "After the expansion of the arms companies in Moscow, it is now essential to expand the benefits of the Russian arms industry to the provinces. There, Russian military contractors will be able to find more space to conduct military tests than they do in underground test facilities in urban areas. However, it is first necessary to supply these regions with talented individuals to aid in this endeavor."
 SOV_education_reform:0 "Российское образование"
 SOV_education_reform_desc:0 "While the secluded education system of Soviet Union had been mostly sufficient for the USSR's interests, the liberalization of Russia and the public access to information from the west showcased to the Russian public how far behind the education system really was behind western counterparts. The Putin administration made it one of its key policy goals to improve the quality of Russia's education system."

 SOV_take_control_of_local_administrations_desc:0 "United Russia, in its overarching goal of forming Russia into a unified national interest bloc that can enforce a strong and assertive domestic and foreign policy agenda, is intolerant of opposition and local political activism against the government, especially from outside the party."
 SOV_oppress_the_opposition:0 "Угнетение оппозиции"
 SOV_oppress_the_opposition_desc:0 "Although United Russia has in the past allied with the CPRF and some centrist forces to further its own agenda, the communists, centrists, and LDPR have at some point become little but a nuisance. While there officially wouldn't be a ban on opposition parties, their activism and organization must be disturbed at every turn to the point that United Russia's own candidates are overbearingly favored in any contest."
 SOV_encourage_industrial_growth:0 "Стимулирование промышленного роста"
 SOV_encourage_industrial_growth_desc:0 "With the federal government's control strengthened and local voices of dissent less likely to stir up trouble, more parts of Russia's wide open spaces and more of its diverse and numerous population can be used to further the goal of Russian economic growth and recovery from the recession of the 1990s."
 SOV_aggressive_foreign_policy:0 "Агрессивная внешняя политика"
 SOV_aggressive_foreign_policy_desc:0 "With the home front secured from internal opposition and whiners, Russia can now ramp up saberrattling and outwardly belligerent rhetoric. At the forefront of any Russian foreign policy position needs to stand the protection of exiled ethnic Russian populations that could provide pretexts for influence, intervention or invasion of sovereign third parties."
 SOV_encourage_military_production:0 "Российское оружейное производство"
 SOV_encourage_military_production_desc:0 "With an economic recovery from our civilian crisis underway, the government needs to encourage the military industry to, even if just for a moment, live beyond its means and overproduce military equipment to further encourage foreign enthusiasm over profit potentials in Russia's domestic defense industries. As a useful side effect, our armed forces would also gain a lot of guns from that."
 SOV_the_dictatorship:0 "Диктатор"
 SOV_the_dictatorship_desc:0 "It is no longer necessary to play to the fiddle of supposed parliamentary democratic values. Vladimir Putin, Dmitry Medvedev and their United Russia know better than their so-called political rivals, and it is no longer a needed aspect of Russian political life to have the populous weigh political visions against one another.

 SOV_2008_military_reforms_desc:0 "The Russian military, still logistically in shambles since the collapse and fracturing of the Soviet Red Army, is a bloated and ineffective fighting force that has proven more than flawed, including a humiliating defeat in the First Chechen War of 1996. A Russian government task force around Anatoly Serdyukov have made ambitious plans to reform the Russian forces, especially the Russian officer corps."
 SOV_reassure_belarus:0 "Восстановить доверие Беларуси"
 SOV_reassure_belarus_desc:0 "Since the 1998 "Treaty on Equal Rights of Citizens", Russia and Belarus, known as the binational 'Union State' since 1996, have formed strong political, economic and social ties. Belarus under Alexander Lukashenko, often called 'Europe's last dictator', has been an unsure actor that fled from western encroachment into the Russian embrace. It is necessary to maintain the mutually beneficial relationship."
 SOV_tighten_the_union_state:0 "Усилить союзное государство"
 SOV_tighten_the_union_state_desc:0 "The 1996 Union State between Russian and Belarus attempted to remove trade barriers and cultural divisions between the two parties, but it made the critical error of setting them both as equals. Russia, as the natural protective power of all of Eastern Europe, must keep close tabs on Belarussian policy to prevent them from slipping into any foolish pro-western mindset."
 SOV_pressure_ukraine:0 "Сильная Украина"
 SOV_pressure_ukraine_desc:0 "The name 'Ukraine' is descended from a word that literally translates to 'borderland'. The Ukrainian people live in the believe of independence, but their cultural and geographical existence is ultimately dependent on the Russians, their more important and more powerful neighbor. Ukraine is important to maintain as part of the Russian sphere."
 SOV_condemn_ukrainian_russophobes:0 "Осудить украинских русофобов"
 SOV_condemn_ukrainian_russophobes_desc:0 "Recent political changes in Ukraine have made it clear that the Kiev government does not intend to respect the ancient bond between Russia and her Okraina, 'borderland'. To make sure that our turnabout in policy towards Ukraine doesn't cause any backlash among the Russian population, we need to first shift gears in diplomatic rhetoric towards them. Perhaps, a few incidents could also be fabricated."
 SOV_demand_belarussian_annexation:0 "Федерализовать союзное государство"
 SOV_demand_belarussian_annexation_desc:0 "The Union State, which had been thought dead by some of its critics, can now go into the final stage - an actual union. Belarus will surely be glad to join the Russian Federation in the form of the Minsk, Grodno and Gomel Oblasts. This is the logical conclusion of the Lukashenko policy towards Russia and should hopefully not be surprising to Belarussian policy makers."
 SOV_take_crimea:0 "Взять Крым"
 SOV_take_crimea_desc:0 "While we consider the best option against Ukraine, it is vital to seize Crimea, an ethnically Russian and strategically important peninsula across the Sea of Azov from Novorossiysk, with a quick and sudden show of force. The troops that will be deployed to instigate and "assist" a local insurrection against Ukrainian governance shall be unmarked to give Russia plausible deniability in the matter. If we delay the clarity of our troops, that should prevent a sudden western intervention altogether."

 SOV_annex_novorossiya:0 "Аннексировать Новороссию"
 SOV_annex_novorossiya_desc:0 "Novorossiya, or 'New Russia', is the collective term for regions in eastern and southern Ukraine that are mainly populated by ethnic Russians. The Novorossiyans were indifferent to what Soviet Republic they lived under during the times of the USSR, but they were torn from their homeland after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Now, they are no longer happy in independent Ukraine. That is unacceptable."

 SOV_demand_baltic_loyalty_desc:0 "In the 1940s, the Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were strongarmed into membership in the Soviet Union after brief stints with independence between the 1920s and 1930s. Although a similar attempt by the Soviet Union to convince Finland of its noble intentions ended up somewhat backfiring, it can not be denied that Baltic membership in Russia was hugely beneficial. For Russia, that is."

 SOV_settle_the_estonian_question_desc:0 "More than 300,000 ethnic Russians call Estonia their home, primarily in the Harju and Ida-Viru counties close to the Russian border. Overall, ethnic Russians make up for about a quarter of Estonia's population, and they are group of our people now forced into all kinds of humiliating memberships in western-infected organizations like NATO and the European Union. This question needs to be settled."
 SOV_settle_the_latvian_question:0 "Урегулировать латышский вопрос"
 SOV_settle_the_latvian_question_desc:0 "Almost a million Russians were left in Latvia after the collapse of the USSR. While around half of this group left Latvia since, about 500,000 Russians are left in Riga's yoke. Still, this equals about a quarter of the Latvian population and, next to Estonia, marks yet another part of the Russian people that were driven from political association with their rightful homeland by western interference. That is unacceptable."
 SOV_attack_lithuania:0 "Атаковать Литву"
 SOV_attack_lithuania_desc:0 "After having settled the issues of ethnic Russian minorities in Estonia and Latvia, it is now in order to, in a more overt move of aggression, connect the Kaliningrad Oblast with the Russian mainland. The small country that stands in the way is Lithuania, which broke away from the USSR in 1991 and has since heavily aligned with the western powers, along with its Baltic brethren."
 SOV_attack_finland:0 "Сфабриковать еще несколько инцидентов в Финляндии"
 SOV_attack_finland_desc:0 "In the winter of 1938/1939, Finland cowardly attacked the Soviet Union in what were definitely unstaged and genuine military attacks against Soviet soldiers that were innocently standing around. While the USSR managed to establish a protective barrier of new territories against the evil Finnish menace, it is clear that his lowly people cannot be trusted. Ceterum censeo Finnoniam esse delendam."

 SOV_attack_sweden_desc:0 "While it will be really hard to justify an attack against Sweden, it is probably safe to say that no one likes those Surströmming-gobbling Viking wannabes and their pickled hering anyway. We'll just stroll by with some tanks and trust that no one cares. Let's go, boys."
 SOV_attack_germany:0 "Конец германской гегемонии"
 SOV_attack_germany_desc:0 "Otto von Bismarck in his time attempted at all costs to avoid wars between Germany and Russia, but since then, the Germans have shown up on Russia's doorstep again and again and again.

To prepare the strike against the CPRF, the LDPR needs to first remove Zyuganov from the picture. Zyuganov's arrest under some random pretext is important to decapitate the communist movement and deny it political direction."
 SOV_political_purges:0 "Политические чистки"
 SOV_political_purges_desc:0 "After defeating the moderate conservatives and Yeltsin's little lapdog, the LDPR must make sure that the Russian people no longer see them as any sort of viable alternative to the future vision endorsed by Zhirinovsky and his peers. For that, local administrators, judges, council clerks, mayors, police chiefs and university professors friendly to the Yeltsin regime must be weeded out."
 SOV_crush_the_communists:0 "Сокрушить коммунистов"
 SOV_crush_the_communists_desc:0 "The Communist Party is a decadent and shameful stain on Russian history. It emerged from insurrectionist rabble that was unwilling to accept their rightful place in society, and it will remain a permanent threat to the LDPR position of power in Russia. Only the altogether removal of communist influence from the Russian political landscape can help."
 SOV_increase_military_spending:0 "Увеличение военных расходов"
 SOV_increase_military_spending_desc:0 "The military is the most important organization of any self-respecting state. The Russian military, traditionally full of a nationalistic class of young officers, could be the most important pillar for the Zhirinovsky administration - if only they can be convinced to be loyal to the new government. An increase in military spending will increase domestic stability and military quality."
 SOV_hyper_nationalism:0 "Гипернационализм"
 SOV_hyper_nationalism_desc:0 "Through the total submission of the individual to the national collective, the collective can gain strength, power, and standing in the world. Russian children need to be taught from an early age that their purpose is to serve Russia, and that Russia must be preserved at all cost, even at the cost of the life of any given Russian. Except for LDPR leaders of course, they will remain in their offices, safe and sound."

 SOV_punish_yeltsins_cronies_desc:0 "With society increasingly in line with the Zhirinovsky administration's political agenda, the political and economic elites are next to be tackled. The oligarchs, a dangerous class that got rich during the privatization of post-Soviet Russian corporations, must be subjugated and forced into the new system. Those who submit will remain in their posts, and those who resist will be put on lists."
 SOV_revoke_personal_freedoms:0 "Отменить личню свободу"
 SOV_revoke_personal_freedoms_desc:0 "Although such moves cannot be made in the open just yet, the LDPR must see to the subversion of the Russian justice system to prevent the government from being held up by individual opponents and critics in the courts. By placing loyal adherents of the Zhirinovsky agenda in key positions of judicial and legislative power, the courts could potentially be eliminated as a threat to government power."
 SOV_execute_the_oligarchs:0 "Охота на нелояльных олигархов"

The liberal experiment of 1991 has failed. It is not in the Russian's character to embrace a pluralistic, democratic or individualistic society. These are western ideas. The Russian prospers as part of a powerful machine. Russia is that machine."

 SOV_encourage_foreign_cheap_laborers_desc:0 "While we are dealing with the minority problems in Chechnya, Dagestan and other troublesome regions, it is still important to keep our factories running at all costs. Underhandedly, away from the public eye, we need to encourage guest workers from neighboring countries that are economically inferior to Russia. These guest workers will be strictly supervised and kept separate from Russian society."
 SOV_dictatorial_coup:0 "Диктаторский переворот"
 SOV_dictatorial_coup_desc:0 "While suggestions have been made that Zhirinovsky aims to crown himself the new Tsar of the Russians, our glorious leader is less than interested in such matters. He is much more like Julius Caesar, the man that the title of 'Tsar' is named after. He rose through the ranks of politics to liberate the nation from its own baggage of democracy and consensus votes."
 SOV_claim_the_crown:0 "Претендовать на корону"
 SOV_claim_the_crown_desc:0 "The Revolution of 1917, a product of the vile subversive communists and their Jewish overlords, threw Russia into its deepest national crisis of all time. The execution of the Romanovs, an honorable and patriotic ruling family, marked the beginning of unstable republicanism and evil meddling by foreign forces. Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who will become Russia's next Tsar, is the man born to fix all these problems."

 SOV_reinforce_the_one_party_state_desc:0 "After the recent political turmoil, it is perhaps best to inform the Russian people that everything is well and good. After all, this state is not too dissimilar from previous iterations of the Russian government, and the liberal phase of the 1990s produced nothing but trouble anyway. A One Party State, this time run by the rightly guided Zhirinovsky administration, is best for Russia."
 SOV_ensure_military_loyalty:0 "Обеспечить военную лояльность"
 SOV_ensure_military_loyalty_desc:0 "With the recent political makeover of Russian society, it is now in order to ensure that the Russian military, so far a good and faithful supporter of the Zhirinovsky movement, has remained committed to the cause. We expect no issues, and with a few administrative replacements at the top of the army, we should be able to secure the domestic and foreign safety of Russia."
 SOV_honor_the_romanovs:0 "Почитать Романовых"
 SOV_honor_the_romanovs_desc:0 "Zhirinovsky's self-coronation, almost Napoleonic in nature, is bound to ruffle a few feathers with most Russians who have bad memories of Soviet-style authoritarian government. It is best to paint over public association with the Soviet dictators and to instead stress the continuity between the Zhirinovsky monarchy and the deposed Romanov dynasty that was overthrown by the Bolsheviks in 1917."
 SOV_secure_kazakhstan:0 "Безопасный Казахстан"
 SOV_secure_kazakhstan_desc:0 "While outright annexation of Kazakhstan is perhaps unnecessary - the inclusion of too many Muslims in the Russian nation is bound to be toxic for the country's ethnic health -, the self-driven and insubordinate spirit of the Kazakh people might lead them to turn against their current alliance with the Russian state.

 SOV_secure_the_grand_duchy_desc:0 "Finland's independence was one of Russia history's most regrettable missteps.

To revive Russia, it is first essential to drive out the international capitalist class."
 SOV_mobilize_the_masses:0 "Мобилизовать массы"
 SOV_mobilize_the_masses_desc:0 "A revolution cannot be carried by a vanguard party alone. The CPRF needs to win the hearts and minds of Russian workers and farmers to mobilize them for the revolutionary efforts and to get them engaged politically and economically.

 SOV_weaken_the_banks:0 "Ослабить банки"
 SOV_weaken_the_banks_desc:0 "Banks are the praetorian guard of capitalism, carrying its banner into combat and defending its profits with their very existence.

 SOV_crackdown_on_nationalists_desc:0 "While the Soviet Union at times used nationalism to great effect, for example when calling upon the Russian spirit against Poland in 1920 or when waging a 'Great Patriotic War' against Germany in 1941, it must ultimately be recognized that the nationalistic chauvinist is not good for communism. While healthy patriotism shall remain in every communist, nationalism must be crushed."

 SOV_the_fifth_international_desc:0 "The Soviet communist movement had a rift open up between proponents of the Stalinist Third International and the eventual Trotzkyist Fourth International beginning in the early 1920s. This rift was driven to a bloody climax when the USSR started purging proponents of Trotzkyism, up to and including the prospect for natural resources via ice pick in Leon Trotzky's skull. We need a new international."

The first focus should be domestic stabilization, but ultimately, the CPRF's influence should also be carried abroad, for the good of Russia and the good of the world."

 SOV_take_control_of_the_oligarchy_desc:0 "The oligarchy is a dangerous clique of capitalist autocrats that operate Russia's economy from an ivory tower of unaccountable influence and sheer endless wealth. The vision of the communist planned economy and the transition to stateless communism does however require strong economic control and large-scale economic interventionism. By just replacing the oligarchs with our party officials, we will be able to take over the economy seemlessly."
 SOV_civilian_industrial_councils:0 "Гражданские промышленные советы"
 SOV_civilian_industrial_councils_desc:0 "In our efforts to rekindle Russian industrialism, we must create jobs that focus on carrying the Russian economy through the construction of a large amount of heavy machinery. While these jobs are not necessarily created to export any goods, we can also do so if we choose to support revolutionary movements with Russian-created machinery."
 SOV_military_industrial_councils:0 "Военно-промышленные советы"
 SOV_military_industrial_councils_desc:0 "Expanding upon our calculations that we could use Civilian Industrial Councils, we could also invest in a collective-owned (that is to say, party-controlled) defense industry. With such a tool in our hands, we can create weapons that will not only allow us to guard Red Russia but also to support revolutionary movements around the world that aim to establish their own local version of communism."
 SOV_the_sfsr:0 "РСФСР"
 SOV_the_sfsr_desc:0 "We should not make the same mistake that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union's communism. The equality of nations under the USSR was a critical mistake, and we must instead engage in a nationally founded communism that is exclusively focussed on the needs, desires and sentiments of the Russians as a people and Russia as a nation. As a result, our communist state will be stronger and less likely to collapse to minorities."
 SOV_the_ussr:0 "СССР"
 SOV_the_ussr_desc:0 "While we must be mindful of the nationalist separatism that led to the collapse of the first USSR, the creation of a second USSR is vital to the continuation of the Soviet revolution.

 SOV_scientific_councils:0 "Научные советы"
 SOV_scientific_councils_desc:0 "We must endeavor to accelerate the careers of the brightest minds among young Russians through the country's best schools and universities to ultimately serve the revolution and the motherland at the scientific frontlines. Discovering new inventions, testing new hypotheses and developing new weapon systems, these prodigies will allow us to fortify and spread our glorious revolution."
 SOV_the_red_army:0 "Красная армия"
 SOV_the_red_army_desc:0 "The re-establishment of a communist-controlled army is absolutely necessary to overcome the threat of reactionary counterrevolution from within the armed forces. By binding the Red Army to the revolution's cause, just like it has been in 1917 and in 1941, we will create a military that serves not the interest of reactionary conservatives but that instead spearheads the communist revolution and that protects the working class."
 SOV_defensive_precautions_west:0 "Западные защитные меры"
 SOV_defensive_precautions_west_desc:0 "Our strongest potential enemies lay west of Russia's borders, in Europe. Supported by north American interventionists, the western 'democracies' will aim to ultimately serve their capitalist agenda by bringing about the downfall of the Russian communist system. We must prepare for a defensive struggle for life and death in conventional warfare. And, if necessary, we will nuke our way to revolution too."
 SOV_communist_ambitions:0 "Коммунистические амбиции"
 SOV_communist_ambitions_desc:0 "We must aid our state's and our ideology's ultimate goals by fully subjugating all elements of state, economy, military and politics to serve the overarching goals of communist ideology as laid out in the old great works of the 1840s and the Russian expansion on communist doctrine between the 1910s and the 1930s."
 SOV_defensive_precautions_south:0 "Южные защитные меры"
 SOV_defensive_precautions_south_desc:0 "While our most dangerous enemies are west of us, war with them is not too likely. But to the south, Russia is faced with far more dangerous elements. Georgia aims to oppress ethnic Russians in its north, the Central Asian republics look towards both Beijing and Washington for guidance, and the Middle East is still dominated by reactionary islamist circles that aim to destroy all that communists hold dear."
 SOV_territorial_demands:0 "Территориальные требования"
 SOV_territorial_demands_desc:0 "The restoration of Soviet glory must ultimately come through the dissolution of those nation states that were created by capitalists to safeguard their capital from the communist revolution. Which is essentially all nation states, really."
 SOV_baltic_republics:0 "Балтийские республики"
 SOV_baltic_republics_desc:0 "The re-establishment of Soviet Republics in the Baltic might seem dangerous because of Estonia's, Latvia's and Lithuania's ties with the west, but communism must not be hindered by the diplomatic maneuvers by capitalist policy makers. Ultimately, they are all cowards, and we will overcome their bullying on our way to restore and rebuild our beloved Soviet Union."
 SOV_caucasian_republics:0 "Кавказские республики"
 SOV_caucasian_republics_desc:0 "Striking south into the Caucasus will allow us to swiftly and decisively beat back western meddling in Russia's underbelly, and put the Soviet Union back on Turkey's border. There is not better way to keep NATO in check than by threatening them at all fronts at the same time."
 SOV_southern_republics:0 "Южные республики"
 SOV_southern_republics_desc:0 "The republics of Asia were never particularly central - except geographically - to Soviet life, but they were a vital and valued part of the communist experience nonetheless. It was here that the USSR conquered space. It was here that the USSR mastered the atom. The USSR was here to stay, and its removal was illegitimate. It shall be restored."
 SOV_communist_europe:0 "Коммунизм в Европе"
 SOV_communist_europe_desc:0 "While Europeans generally give communism rather poor ratings, this is mostly based on the scaremongering of the capitalist class. The track record must be set straight. We just have to kick in the door, and the whole rotten structure will come crashing down."

 SOV_deals_with_europe_desc:0 "Whereas Zhirinovsky speaks of neo-imperial Russian glory and Zyuganov favors the creation of neo-Soviet systems of government (with implicit annexations to boot), Yavlinsky cares mainly about the economic prosperity of the Russian Federation and the individual fortunes of each Russian. We must befriend Europe, not attack her."
 SOV_national_economic_goals:0 "Национальные экономические цели"
 SOV_national_economic_goals_desc:0 "The Russian economic stagnation of the 1990s set the country back decades in development and left her a second-rate power behind the western democracies.

 SOV_baltic_economic_cooperation:0 "Балтийское экономическое сотрудничество"
 SOV_baltic_economic_cooperation_desc:0 "The Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania still view Russia as a great threat. They remember Russian imperialism of the 18th and 19th Centuries and the Soviet annexation of 1940. The new Russia has left those interventionist roads of bloodshed behind. We will be the friends of the Balts, to both our mutual profit. This is the best way to keep ethnic Russians in the Baltic safe."
 SOV_european_university_connections:0 "Европейские университетские связи"
 SOV_european_university_connections_desc:0 "Yavlinsky has made it a core goal of his policy to improve the quality of higher education in Russia. The best universities in the world are to be found in the western democracies, and Russia must endeavor to connect its own university system with that of its western partners to allow Russia's students to remain internationally competitive with their western peers."
 SOV_russian_defensive_preparations:0 "Оборонительные приготовления России"
 SOV_russian_defensive_preparations_desc:0 "While the military is not Yavlinsky's primary focus, it remains a vital pillar of Russia's national structure and a great source of the patriotic pride of Russians. It is also important to keep Russia safe from domestic terrorism, and it has been suspected that Yavlinsky's pro-western stance might make enemies of Beijing. Regardless of who they fight, the Russian forces must be ready to meet the challenge."
 SOV_kaliningrad_development:0 "Возрождение Калининграда"
 SOV_kaliningrad_development_desc:0 "Cut off from mainland Russia by the Baltic States, the Kaliningrad Oblast is an often forgotten part of the Federation. It is however indeed vitally important as a seaport in the Baltic Sea, especially during winter, and it provides a sneaky internal border for 'domestic flights' that can thus bypass the Baltic States to directly deliver goods to Poland and beyond. And economic revitalization is important."
 SOV_fight_the_elites:0 "Бороться с элитой"
 SOV_fight_the_elites_desc:0 "The Russian people have been unfairly described as a people that is naturally drawn to authoritarian forms of government. This western caricature was a result of the Tsarist totalitarianism being immediately followed by a totalitarian communist coup against a weak democracy. We must not repeat the mistakes of the elitist Kerensky state. We are the state of the Russians, not another autocracy."
 SOV_democratic_idealism:0 "Демократический идеализм"
 SOV_democratic_idealism_desc:0 "Although the past political systems don't show great track records for Russian democracy, the Russians are an enlightened people that desire political participation and individual freedoms and self-expression.

 SOV_kaliningrad_military_sector_desc:0 "Kaliningrad is a fantastic spot to create a powerful subsector of the Russian defense industry, as it is in a prime spot to export military goods into the European economic area as well as into the maritime trade network via its access to the Baltic Sea."

 SOV_expand_the_university_of_moscow_desc:0 "Russia is home to some of the world's brightest individuals, like Grigori Perelman, Garry Kasparov and Zhores Alferov. However, even though Russia has such vast intellectual potential, it remains largely untapped in the nation's education system, as the country's most accomplished individuals are often drawn abroad. We must improve our own system to entice them to stay."
 SOV_soviet_trials:0 "Советский опыт"
 SOV_soviet_trials_desc:0 "To bring accountability to the Russian people, our new liberalized state needs to make sure that past crimes against the commoners, committed by bureaucrats and party cadres of the Soviet Union, do not go unpunished. We must shine a light on the Soviet surveillance state, on the USSR's political oppression and on the self-enrichment schemes that were in place during the time of the Soviet Union."
 SOV_reformed_russian_armed_forces:0 "Реорганизованные Вооруженные Силы России"
 SOV_reformed_russian_armed_forces_decs:0 "Although the new Russia rejects aggressive military force as a means to an end, it is still a large country with a long list of potential enemies, both internal and external. While we might have qualms about conscription and other forms of forced service, that does not mean that we should just leave our military forces by the wayside. The armed forces must continue development."
 SOV_russia_studies_abroad:0 "Российские студенты зарубежом"
 SOV_russia_studies_abroad_desc:0 "As part of the new state's education outreach, it is necessary to win favorable opinions of both our nation and its education system by offering courses, both Russian and otherwise, about Russia and the Russian language in foreign countries.

 SOV_fight_communism_desc:0 "As part of our anti-Soviet sentiment, we also need to lead young people away from the dangerous influence of communism. We need to include historical and economic lessons in the education system that stress the risk of communist totalitarianism and the volatility of planned economies."
 SOV_fight_nationalism:0 "Искоренить националистов"
 SOV_fight_nationalism_desc:0 "Next to our efforts to discourage young Russians from becoming communists, we also have to prevent them from becoming right-wing weirdos as well. Blaming historical episodes like the world wars on nationalism and stressing the economic dangers of protectionist isolationism should discourage many attentive students from falling to these dangerous ideas."
 SOV_approach_nato:0 "Политика НАТО"
 SOV_approach_nato_desc:0 "While there is no doubt that historically NATO was created specifically against Moscow, the state that ruled Moscow in 1949 is gone. With the Soviet Union's downfall, a virile and strong democratic Russia has risen, and virile strong democracies is exactly what NATO needs."
 SOV_maintain_csto:0 "Поддержать ОДКБ"
 SOV_maintain_csto_desc:0 "While we do not seek conflict with NATO, it is clear that membership in that organization would come with its own bureaucratic and tactical nightmares. Many NATO states don't trust Russia, and it is not advisable for our security to allow them access to too much information about our military. We shall stick with our own CSTO, established in the late 1990s."
 SOV_bastion_of_democracy:0 "Бастион демократии"
 SOV_bastion_of_democracy_desc:0 "With the liberties of the citizens of Russia secured and extremism fought off, it is safe to say that our country has truly become a bastion of democracy.

 SOV_bring_democracy_to_central_asia_desc:0 "As part of our efforts to 'secure' the political freedoms of the people of the former Soviet Union, we should strongly consider dealing with the autocrats of Central Asia.

 SOV_liberalize_russian_society:0 "Либерализовать русское общество"
 SOV_liberalize_russian_society_desc:0 "It has been asserted that the Russians as a people are unfit for democracy and predetermined to live under authoritarian rule.

Our new society is more liberal and freedom-loving than any that came before it."
 SOV_russian_values:0 "Российские ценности"

 SOV_more_universities:0 "Интенсифицировать инвестиции в образование"
 SOV_more_universities_desc:0 "At the beginning of every free thinker stands a wise and benevolent mentor that teaches the free thinker to think freely. In the case of our state, this mentor is the Russian education system - which could be a problem, considering the Russian education system is chronically underfunded. More money needs to be diverted towards the education system."
 SOV_full_secularism:0 "Государственный спонсируемый секуляризм"
 SOV_full_secularism_desc:0 "When discussing religious values, we need to make sure to distance ourselves from all religious institutions, especially the Orthodox Church.

 SOV_military_reform:0 "Военные реформы"
 SOV_military_reform_desc:0 "The dissolution of the Soviet Union left the Armed Forces of its member states outdated and underfunded. Where the United States and its NATO allies kept investing in their militaries, the soldiers of the post-Soviet republics received essentially no new equipment or doctrines. We have a lot of ground to cover and a lot of headstart to make up for."
 SOV_army_reform:0 "Сухопутные"
 SOV_army_reform_desc:0 "The Sukhoputnye, 'Ground Forces', are the land-based branch of the Russian army, and the one that probably needs the most attention in order to account for Russia's geographic predisposition being both very big and very attackable.

 SOV_armored_reform:0 "Мобильные войска"

 SOV_european_interaction_plan:0 "Европейский план взаимодействия"
 SOV_european_interaction_plan_desc:0 "We need a plan to properly interact with the European powers that have vital economic relations with us (and sometimes sanctions towards us as well)."
 SOV_appease_foreign_powers:0 "Умиротворить иностранные державы"
 SOV_appease_foreign_powers_desc:0 "To secure Russia's domestic and foreign peace, the great powers abroad need to both stop looking at Russia as an imminent threat and to stop looking at Russia as a potential victim. If we can convince the foreigners that we are no longer a direct threat to them, their punitive force against us might decrease."
 SOV_nordstream:0 "Северный поток"
 SOV_nordstream_desc:0 "Nord Stream is a gas pipeline project through the Baltic Sea to one of Russia's main gas recipients, Germany. Such a system allows Russia and Germany bypass the states of Eastern Europe for their gas transfers, thus giving Russia free hand to bully those countries, and Germany the freedom to ignore the bullying."
 SOV_discuss_lifting_sanctions:0 "Обсудить отмену санкций"
 SOV_discuss_lifting_sanctions_desc:0 "We must approach the foreign powers that sanction us to lift their sanctions. Surely, we have done enough to appease them?"
 SOV_south_stream:0 "Южный поток"
 SOV_south_stream_desc:0 "A counterpart to Nord Stream, the Southstream pipeline is a gas pipeline program that leads from the Rostov region in Russia through the Black Sea. The pipeline is to pass through Bulgaria, and then split north towards Austria and south towards Italy."

 SOV_revaluation_of_the_ruble_desc:0 "Over the last decade, the value of the Russian currency, the Ruble, has plummetted due to unwise foreign trade policy decisions as well as inadequate prevention of inflationary effects. We need to restore vale to the Ruble as good as we can."
 SOV_intice_foreign_investment:0 "Иностранные инвестиции"
 SOV_intice_foreign_investment_desc:0 "Russia, although massive, is not in an economic state that befits its impressive size. With Russia's economic elite in a less than ideal state, Russia's local businesses rely on international suppliers and customers to make ends meet. This is where a healthy influx of foreign investors could aid the economic situation of the country."
 SOV_trade_with_nko:0 "Торговля с Северной Кореей"
 SOV_trade_with_nko_desc:0 "The North Korean regime has had one of its few supporters and backers in the Soviet Union. Russia, more concerned with its internal struggles, has failed to properly succeed the USSR as a partner to North Korea's economic and political interests, and has thus allowed Pyongyang to slip into Beijing's sphere of influence. For the sake of our strategic position in the far east, we must re-engage relations."
 SOV_trade_with_sko:0 "Торговля с Южной Кореей"
 SOV_trade_with_sko_desc:0 "For the longest time, Moscow was a tentative supporter of the North Korean regime in Pyongyang. But since the collapse of the Soviet Union, North Korea has firmly joined the rank's of China's geopolitical outreach. Pyongyang no longer depends on Russian assistance, and its rival government in Seoul has shown itself to be more economically talented. Russia should realign its interests to South Korea."
 SOV_trade_with_authoritarianism:0 "Торговля с авторитарными странами"
 SOV_trade_with_authoritarianism_desc:0 "While democracies are free, authoritarianism makes for reliable dependencies. Typically, authoritarian government are worse at expanding their own economic outreach and diversity than democratic states and they are as a result more likely to fall into long-standing economic vassalages to their trade partners. Perhaps, that is a niche in which Russia would fit well."
 SOV_trade_with_democratic_countries:0 "Торговля с демократическими странами"
 SOV_trade_with_democratic_countries_desc:0 "The world's democracies usually have a higher degree of economic freedom, non-intervention of government in private business and financial stability than their autocratic counterparts. As a results, it might be desirable to build up significant trade relations with the world's democratic countries. Russia, ever in need of reliable partners to export its natural resources to, could use good standing with them."
 SOV_expansionary_trade_policy:0 "Расширение торговой политики"
 SOV_expansionary_trade_policy_desc:0 "In a modern, globalized world, it is essential to have a modern, globalized trade policy. Russia is rich in natural resources, but has to catch up to western states in terms of accessibility of high-paying jobs to stop highly qualified Russian workers from emigrating from the country. To do so, Russia paradoxically must not shut down but open up. More trade will result in larger profits and more jobs for Russians."

 russia.1.d:0 "Курская подводная катастрофа была морским инцидентом в 75 км к северу от Кольского полуострова, Россия. \n\nРусская подводная лодка класса «Оскар» К-141 «Курск» потерпела неудачный шов на 65-76 тренировочной торпеде, что вызвало взрыв перекиси и последующую детонацию не менее 5 торпедных боеголовок. \n\nРоссийское морское командование сильно недооценило ситуацию и отказалось от международной помощи на основе грубых утверждений о возможном участии НАТО в потоплении. Хотя многие из членов экипажа пережили первоначальные взрывы, которые даже были зарегистрированы сейсмографами в штате Аляска, и оказались в ловушке под водой, медленный и неэффективный ответ России в конечном итоге привел к гибели всех 118 моряков."

 #Russian News Events
 russia_news.1.t:0 "Владимир Путин избран президентом"
 russia_news.1.d:0 "As was completely predictable, the young political upstart Vladimir Putin, acting president since December 31st, 1999, has been confirmed in his office as President of Russia by popular vote.\n\nPutin was internationally perceived as little more than a puppet who got to power simply because he was Boris Yeltsin's designated political successor, but his recent unforgiving policy on the Chechen insurgency has already proved him to be a more resolute leader than some of his skeptics may expect."
 russia_news.1.o1:0 "Let's see how he does."
 russia_news.2.t:0 "Владимир Жириновский избран президентом"
 russia_news.2.d:0 "Even though most observers expected Boris Yeltsin's heir Vladimir Putin to win, it seems as if the Russian population has chosen the hyper-nationalistic Liberal Democratic Party and their leader, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, to fill the position of Russian President."
 russia_news.2.o1:0 "Карьера Путина подошла к концу."
 russia_news.3.t:0 "Геннадий Зюганов избран президентом"
 russia_news.3.d:0 "In an unexpected turn of events, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation has seen its leader, Gennady Zyuganov, elected to the presidency. This comes as an absolute shock, as the presidency was already considered pre-determined and won by Vladimir Putin, the designated heir of Boris Yeltsin. It appears Russian elections are less (or far more) rigged than expected."
 russia_news.3.o1:0 "Does that mark the rebirth of the USSR?"
 russia_news.4.t:0 "Григорий Явлинский избран президентом"
 russia_news.4.d:0 "Почти совершенно неизвестный в мире политический активист Григорий Явлинский победил на президентских выборах в России, что можно описать только политическим землетрясением. На вопрос о преемственности Бориса Ельцина был дан ответ еще до того, как он был задан, причем Владимир Путин явно пользовался благосклонностью среди различных кандидатов. Но, похоже, что консервативный и олигархически настроенный курс ельцинской власти не помог Путину в его предвыборной кампании. Вместо него российский народ выбрал либерального Явлинского."

Российский военно-морской флот публично дал несколько объяснений, в том числе о столкновении или нападении подводной лодки НАТО. Генеральный секретарь НАТО уже опроверг эти обвинения. Число погибших составляет 118 человек, что равняется всему экипажу К-141."
